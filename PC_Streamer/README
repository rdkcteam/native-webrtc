Step for testing Camera side 


•	git clone https://github.com/rdkcteam/native-webrtc to one ubuntu PC
•	Move to PC_Streamer directory in PC
•	$sudo chmod +x webrtc_cam.sh
•	Execute the script “webrtc_cam.sh” (./webrtc_cam.sh)
•	Then connect webcam to PC. In that PC change directory to webrtc-checkout Folder
        e.g., cd  webrtc-checkout /src/out/Defaults.
•	Execute “. /peerconnection_Server”, then you should see the following message indicating that it is running:
        Server listening on port 8888
•	In another terminal cd webrtc-checkout/out/Defaults
•	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:’pwd’(Export path to /out/Defaults)
•	Execute “./peerconnection _client “
•	Enter the server address and listening port on command line


Step for Testing Viewing side


•       git clone https://github.com/rdkcteam/native-webrtc to another PC
•	Move to PC_Streamer directory in PC(not remotely)
•	$sudo chmod +x webrtc_browser
•	Execute the script “webrtc_browser” (“./webrtc_browser”)
•	Then move in to out/Default folder of webrtc checkout folder.
        e.g., cd  webrtc-checkout /src/out/Defaults.
•	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:’pwd’(Export path to /out/Defaults)
•	Then Execute “. /peerconnection_client”.
•	Now a window for entering server IP and port will display.
•	Enter the server hosting’s machine IP and listening port to that GTK window.
•	Click on connect button.
•	Double click on the peer name list down in the window
•	Verify the video captured by the webcam connected in another PC display in the GTK window.
